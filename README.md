# The Multiplanetary Building Code
The official Multiplanetary Building Code (MBC) will offer a comprehensive and comprehensible set of model standards [necessary](https://github.com/Engineer1119/space-bc/wiki) to support humanity's expansion off-world.

# The mission
To openly adopt, adapt, unify, and share relevant standards from across the world in order to assist all space-facing entities in more affordably and effectively supporting the expansion of humanity beyond Earth, and in order to better serve the needs of the people who will live and work off-world.

# The vision
To define the common ground from which we launch towards the stars.
