# 03 Building Functions
## 03.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to define categories of structures with respect to how they are intended to be used, and who is intended to use them, in order to consistently apply standards particular to their use.

## 03.2 Use
The *use* of a structure is the socioeconomic function it fulfills.

## 03.2C Use
*Use* affects environmental the conditions that both the structure and its occupants will be exposed to during normal operation. *Use* also relates to how the structure is expected to perform when exposed to various hazards.

## 03.3 Occupancy
The *occupancy* of a structure consists of the people who are intended to use it. Occupancy is defined by both the *maximum occupant total* and the *occupant class*.

## 03.3C Occupancy

*Maximum occupant total* is the number of individual humans who can safely use the structure provided that requirements related to such an occupany are satisfied. For simplicity, all occupants are assumed to be healthy adults with standard environmental needs unless otherwise noted.

*Occupant class* accounts for the capability of the occupants to independently respond to hazards. Generally, more capable occupant classes are permitted to occupy structures with proportionally higher exposure to risk.

### 03.3.1 Occupant Class

Table 03.3.1T

| Occupant Class | Definition | Examples
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| O1 | Primary occupants have restricted physical mobility and/or capability. | Hospitals, schools, jails |
| O2 | Primary occupants have unrestricted physical capability but little capability to respond to hazards. | Public areas, businesses, workplaces, hotels, temporary living quarters |
| O3 | Primary occupants have unrestricted physical capability and limited capability to respond to hazards. | Private residential areas, governmental structures |
| O4 | Primary occupants fully capable of independently responding to hazards. | Emergency response personnel centers |

### 03.3.2 Primary Occupant

The *primary occupants* of a structure are the individuals who, under normal operations, are the numerical majority of occupants in the structure.

## 03.4 Related Geometry Requirements
The following uses and occupancies require certain structural geometry requirements to be fulfilled.
