# 08 STRUCTURAL

## 08.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to define the required design capacity of structures as determined by analysis and testing.

## 08.2 Materials

## 08.3 Structure Types

## 08.4 Loading

### 08.4.1 Ambient Gravity
Loads due to the structure and objects affixed to it, including docked and berthed vehicles, in a gravity field

### 08.4.2 Artificial Acceleration
Loads due the mass of the structure and objects affixed to it being accelerated by means including, but not limited to, thrust or rotation.

### 08.4.3 Occupancy
Loads due to the presence of occupants and objects not affixed to the structure during normal use of the structure, including but not limited to vehicles, storage units, and raw materials.

### 08.4.4 Maintenance and Construction
Loads uniquely applied to the structure during its construction or maintenance.

### 08.4.5 Internal Environment
Loads applied to the structure by other aspects of its internal environment, including but not limited to atmospheric pressure and temperature.

### 08.4.6 External Environment
Loads applied to the structure by other aspects of its external environment, including but not limited to atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, retained regolith, and fluids.
