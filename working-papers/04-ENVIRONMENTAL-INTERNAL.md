# 04 Environmental - Internal

## 04.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the environment internal to the structure and to reference the standards applicable to those conditions.

## 04.2 Internal Atmosphere
### 04.2.1 Standard Internal Atmosphere
The standard internal atmosphere shall have a composition complying with 04.2.1.1 and 04.2.1.2.

#### 04.2.1.1 Composition
- 21 kilopascals, diatomic oxygen
- 79 kilopascals, diatomic nitrogen

#### 04.2.1.2 Variation
- constituent gas partial pressure shall not vary by more than [] pascals within a 24-hour period

#### 04.2.1.3 Non-Standard Internal Atmosphere
The building official is permitted to approve a design specifying non-standard atmospheric mixes if all code-specified risks to occupants are demonstrated to be at or below the level provided by a standard atmosphere.

#### 04.2.1.3C Non-Standard Internal Atmosphere
Alternative atmospheric mixes pose unique hazards to occupants, including chemical toxicity, narcosis, and flammability. However, certain operating conditions may require their use.

### 04.2.2 Temperature
#### 04.2.2.1 Maximum Internal Design Temperature
*Maximum internal design temperature* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric temperature,
- maximum fluid temperature, or
- maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

#### 04.2.2.2 Minimum Internal Design Temperature
*Minimum internal design temperature* is the smallest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the minimum atmospheric temperature,
- minimum fluid temperature, or
- minimum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

The minimum need not be taken as any lower than -270.425 degrees Celsius.

#### 04.2.2.2C Minimum Design Temperature
The lower bound on the minimum design temperature is the average cosmic background temperature.

#### 04.2.2.3 Design Temperature Modification
The building official is permitted to approve a design with documentation supporting a higher minimmum design temperature or a lower maximum design temperature.

#### 04.2.2.3C Design Temperature Modification
If temperature extremes determined by 05.2.1.1 and 05.2.1.2 are sufficiently short-term (for example, an orbital station eclipsed by its parent body) the structure may not achieve thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.

#### 04.2.2.4 Design Temperature Range
The Design Temperature Range (DTR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Temperature and Maximum Design Temperature.

#### 04.2.2.5 Thermal Design
The structure design shall account for the DTR and thermal gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

### 04.2.3 Pressure
#### 04.2.3.1 Maximum Internal Design Pressure
*Maximum internal design pressure* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric pressure,
- maximum fluid pressure in direct contact with the structure

#### 04.2.3.2 Minimum Internal Design Pressure
*Minimum internal design pressure* is the minimum atmospheric pressure during the service lifetime of the structure. If the interior structure will be exposed to vacuum during its service lifetime then the minimum external design pressure shall be taken as 0 kPa.

#### 04.2.3.4 Design Pressure Range
The Design Pressure Range (DPR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Pressure and Maximum Design Pressure.

#### 04.2.3.5 Pressure Design
The structure design shall account for the DPR and pressure gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

## 04.3 Hazards
This section defines tiers of design considerations.

### 04.3.1 Thermal
#### 04.3.1.1 Thermal Design Category
The DTR as defined in 04.2.1.4 shall be used to define the Thermal Design Category (TDC) as defined in Table 04.3.1.1T.

Table 04.3.1.1T

| Thermal Design Category | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| T1 | DTR entirely between threshold temperatures. |
| T2 | DTR falls partly outside of the threshold temperature ranges. |
| T3 | DTR entirely falls below the lower threshold temperature. |
| T4 | DTR entirely exceeds the higher threshold temperature. |
| T5 | DTR entirely includes the threshold temperature range. |

#### 04.3.1.2 TDC Threshold Temperatures
The lower TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 0 degrees Celsius.
The higher TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 40 degrees Celsius.

#### 04.3.1.2C TDC Threshold Temperatures
The freezing point of water at STP, 0 degrees Celsius, is used as one of two thresholds to define TDC. 40 degrees Celsius is used as the other thresholds as an upper bound on long-term human survivable temperature.

### 04.3.2 Pressure
#### 04.3.2.1 Pressure Design Category

Table 04.3.2.1T

| Pressure Design Category | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| P1 | DPR entirely between threshold pressures. |
| P2 | DPR falls partly outside of the threshold pressure ranges. |
| P3 | DPR entirely falls below the lower threshold pressure. |
| P4 | DPR entirely exceeds the higher threshold pressure. |
| P5 | DPR entirely includes the threshold pressure range. |

#### 04.3.1.2 PDC Threshold Pressures
The lower PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []
The higher PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []

#### 04.3.2.2C PDC Threshold Pressures
The thresholds used to define PDC are based on typically human-survivable *total* pressure ranges assuming a *standard internal atmospheric composition*, yielding appropriate partial pressures of constituent gases for long-term unassisted breathing without significant risk of nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity. Partial pressure requirements are addressed in []. Emergency underpressure or overpressure requirements are addressed in [].

Commercial and military regulation of breathing gases for high-altitude and hyperbaric diving operations offers comparatively more quantitatively rigorous standards. 

## 04.3.3 Chemical
### 04.3.3.1 Structural Integrity
The structure design shall account for the following aspects of the internal atmosphere and material that it may carry:
- chemical reactivity with the structure
- chemical reactivity with the external atmosphere

## 04.3.4 Biological

## 04.3.5 Radiological

## 04.3.6 Electrical

## 04.3.7 Inertial

## 04.3.8 Vibrational
