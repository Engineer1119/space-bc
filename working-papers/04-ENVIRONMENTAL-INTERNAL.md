# 04 Environmental - Internal

## 04.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the environment internal to the structure and to reference the standards applicable to those conditions.

## 04.2 Internal Atmosphere
### 04.2.1 Standard Internal Atmosphere
The standard internal atmosphere shall have a composition complying with 04.2.1.1 and 04.2.1.2.

### 04.2.1C Standard Internal Atmosphere
For comparison, see Attachment C "Human Rating and Habitability Criteria" to Appendix K: "Commercial Destination Development in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Free Flyer", part of NASA's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2), Broad Agency Announcement NNH16ZCQ001K-CDFF, dated to September 23, 2019. Notes in Table 3 of this document make informal references to standards for the ISS.

#### 04.2.1.1 Composition
- 21 kilopascals, diatomic oxygen
- 79 kilopascals, diatomic nitrogen

#### 04.2.1.1C Composition
The document cited in 04.2.1C states that "the ranges" of 19.4 to 22.7 kilopascals partial pressure of O2 "are nominal physiological values for indefinite human exposure without measurable impairments to health or performance and is within the range that ISS operates."

#### 04.2.1.2 Pressure Variation from Standard
Internal atmospheric pressure shall not increase by more than 800 pascals per second. Internal atmospheric pressure shall not decrease by more than 890 pascals per second.

#### 04.2.1.2C Variation
See Table 3 from the document cited in 04.2.1C.

#### 04.2.1.3 Standard Internal Carbon Dioxide
The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the internal atmosphere shall not exceed 530 pascals.

#### 04.2.1.3C Carbon Dioxide
The document cited in 04.2.1C states that the upper limit of 4.0 mmHg of carbon dioxide partial pressure, and lack of a minimum value, "are nominal physiological values for indefinite human exposure without measurable impairments to health or performance."

#### 04.2.1.4 Standard Internal Temperature
The internal temperature shall be maintained between 18.3 and 26.7 degrees Celsius.

#### 04.2.1.4C Standard Internal Temperature
Per the document cited in 04.2.1C, "these temperature limits protect for human comfort (and thus performance of routine activities) without the use of thermal protective garments."

#### 04.2.1.5 Standard Internal Humidity
Internal atmospheric humidity shall be maintained between 25% and 75%.

#### 04.2.1.5C Standard Internal Humidity
Per the document cited in 04.2.1C, the lower limit is set such that "the environment is not too dry for the nominal functioning of mucous membranes" and to reduce the risk of electrostatic discharge. The upper limit is similarly set "for crew comfort, to allow for effective evaporation, and to limit the formation of condensation."

#### 04.2.1.6 Internal Atmospheric Circulation
The bulk time-average velocity of air shall be between 4.6 and 36.6 meters per minute. The minimum velocity of air shall be between 2.1 and 60.9 meters per minute.

Exclusions:
- the volume of air within 15.2 centimeters of a wall, floor, ceiling, or other fixed solid surface defining the boundaries of the internal atmosphere.
- the volume of air within 7.6 centimeters of permanently fixed mechanical equipment that does not require air flow for nominal functionality.

#### 04.2.1.6C Internal Atmospheric Circulation
Values from Table 3 of the document cited in 04.2.1C. The document cited in 04.2.1C further cites NASA document JSC 65993, Commercial Human-Systems Integration Requirements, CH6008 "for rationale pertaining to values." 

#### 04.2.1.7 Non-Standard Internal Atmosphere
The building official is permitted to approve a design specifying non-standard atmospheric mixes if all code-specified risks to occupants are demonstrated to be at or below the level provided by a standard atmosphere. Permanently fixed signage shall be placed at all human-accessible entrances to volumes containing non-standard atmospheric mixes indicating all of the following in legible script:
- the approved use of a non-standard internal atmosphere,
- the conditions of use,
- placards complying with United Nations hazardous materials (HAZMAT U.N.) labeling requirements for all relevant substances within or forming the non-standard atmosphere,
- a diagram indicating the locations and functions of any equipment used to maintain, create, and vent the non-standard atmosphere, and
- a full description of deviations from the standard atmosphere.

Separations between standard internal atmospheres and non-standard internal atmospheres shall comply with all requirements pertaining to separations between standard internal atmospheres and external atmospheres.

#### 04.2.1.7C Non-Standard Internal Atmosphere
Alternative atmospheric mixes pose unique hazards to occupants, including chemical toxicity, narcosis, and flammability. However, certain operating conditions may require their use.

### 04.2.2 Temperature
#### 04.2.2.1 Maximum Internal Design Temperature
*Maximum internal design temperature* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric temperature,
- maximum fluid temperature, or
- maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

#### 04.2.2.2 Minimum Internal Design Temperature
*Minimum internal design temperature* is the smallest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the minimum atmospheric temperature,
- minimum fluid temperature, or
- minimum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

The minimum need not be taken as any lower than -270.425 degrees Celsius.

#### 04.2.2.2C Minimum Design Temperature
The lower bound on the minimum design temperature is the average cosmic background temperature.

#### 04.2.2.3 Design Temperature Modification
The building official is permitted to approve a design with documentation supporting a higher minimmum design temperature or a lower maximum design temperature.

#### 04.2.2.3C Design Temperature Modification
If temperature extremes determined by 05.2.1.1 and 05.2.1.2 are sufficiently short-term (for example, an orbital station eclipsed by its parent body) the structure may not achieve thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.

#### 04.2.2.4 Design Temperature Range
The Design Temperature Range (DTR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Temperature and Maximum Design Temperature.

#### 04.2.2.5 Thermal Design
The structure design shall account for the DTR and thermal gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

- maximum fluid pressure in direct contact with the structure

#### 04.2.3.2 Minimum Internal Design Pressure
*Minimum internal design pressure* is the minimum atmospheric pressure during the service lifetime of the structure. If the interior structure will be exposed to vacuum during its service lifetime then the minimum external design pressure shall be taken as 0 kPa.

#### 04.2.3.4 Design Pressure Range
The Design Pressure Range (DPR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Pressure and Maximum Design Pressure.

### 04.3.1 Thermal
#### 04.3.1.1 Thermal Design Category
The DTR as defined in 04.2.1.4 shall be used to define the Thermal Design Category (TDC) as defined in Table 04.3.1.1T.

Table 04.3.1.1T

| Thermal Design Category | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| T1 | DTR entirely between threshold temperatures. |
| T2 | DTR falls partly outside of the threshold temperature ranges. |
| T3 | DTR entirely falls below the lower threshold temperature. |
| T4 | DTR entirely exceeds the higher threshold temperature. |
| T5 | DTR entirely includes the threshold temperature range. |

#### 04.3.1.2 TDC Threshold Temperatures
The lower TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 0 degrees Celsius.
The higher TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 40 degrees Celsius.

#### 04.3.1.2C TDC Threshold Temperatures
The freezing point of water at STP, 0 degrees Celsius, is used as one of two thresholds to define TDC. 40 degrees Celsius is used as the other thresholds as an upper bound on long-term human survivable temperature.

#### 04.3.2.1 Pressure Design Category

Table 04.3.2.1T

| Pressure Design Category | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |

| P2 | DPR falls partly outside of the threshold pressure ranges. |
| P3 | DPR entirely falls below the lower threshold pressure. |
| P4 | DPR entirely exceeds the higher threshold pressure. |
| P5 | DPR entirely includes the threshold pressure range. |

#### 04.3.1.2 PDC Threshold Pressures
The lower PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []
The higher PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []

#### 04.3.2.2C PDC Threshold Pressures
The thresholds used to define PDC are based on typically human-survivable *total* pressure ranges assuming a *standard internal atmospheric composition*, yielding appropriate partial pressures of constituent gases for long-term unassisted breathing without significant risk of nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity. Partial pressure requirements are addressed in []. Emergency underpressure or overpressure requirements are addressed in [].

See [United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter F, Part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules Subpart C—Equipment, Instrument, and Certificate Requirements, Docket No. 18334, 54 FR 34304 §91.211 Supplemental oxygen of August 18, 1989](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2b854616f1b780d1a92192497b708362&mc=true&node=pt14.2.91&rgn=div5#se14.2.91_1211) for an example of regulation of the partial pressure of oxygen in civil aircraft with implicit limits on the exposure of crew and passengeres to the risk of hypoxic conditions.

Commercial and military regulation of breathing gases for high-altitude and hyperbaric diving operations offers comparatively more quantitatively rigorous standards.
