# 05 Environmental - External

## 05.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the environment external to the structure and to reference the standards applicable to those conditions.

## 05.2 External Atmosphere
### 05.2.1 Temperature
#### 05.2.1.1 Maximum External Design Temperature
*Maximum external design temperature* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric temperature,
- maximum fluid temperature, or
- maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

#### 05.2.1.2 Minimum Design Temperature
*Minimum temperature* is the larger of the maximum atmospheric temperature, maximum fluid temperature, or maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure during the service lifetime of the structure.

The minimum need not be taken as any lower than -270.425 degrees Celsius.

#### 05.2.1.2C Minimum Design Temperature
The lower bound on the minimum design temperature is the average cosmic background temperature.

#### 05.2.1.3 Design Temperature Modification
The building official is permitted to approve a design with documentation supporting a higher minimmum design temperature or a lower maximum design temperature.

#### 05.2.1.3C Design Temperature Modification
If temperature extremes determined by 05.2.1.1 and 05.2.1.2 are sufficiently short-term (for example, an orbital station eclipsed by its parent body) the structure may not achieve thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.

#### 05.2.1.4 Thermal Design
The structure design shall account for the maximum design temperature, minimum design temperature, and thermal gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

### 05.2.2 Pressure
#### 05.2.2.1 Maximum External Design Pressure
*Maximum external design pressure* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric pressure,
- maximum fluid pressure in direct contact with the structure

#### 05.2.2.2 Minimum External Design Pressure
*Minimum external design pressure* is the minimum atmospheric pressure during the service lifetime of the structure. If the structure will be exposed to vacuum during its service lifetime then the minimum external design pressure shall be taken as 0 kPa.

### 05.2.3 Composition

The structure design shall account for the following aspects of the external atmosphere and material that it may carry:

- chemical reactivity with the structure
- chemical reactivity with the internal atmosphere

If the structure will remain in vacuum for the duration of its service lifetime, then the structure design shall account for:

- chemical reactivity with solar wind
