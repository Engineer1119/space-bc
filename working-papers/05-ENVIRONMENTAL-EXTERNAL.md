# 05 Environmental - External

## 05.1 General
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the environment external to the structure and to reference the standards applicable to those conditions.

## 05.2 External Atmosphere
### 05.2.1 Temperature
#### 05.2.1.1 Maximum External Design Temperature
*Maximum external design temperature* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric temperature,
- maximum fluid temperature, or
- maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure

#### 05.2.1.2 Minimum Design Temperature
*Minimum temperature* is the larger of the maximum atmospheric temperature, maximum fluid temperature, or maximum temperature of solids in direct contact with the structure during the service lifetime of the structure.

The minimum need not be taken as any lower than -270.425 degrees Celsius.

#### 05.2.1.2C Minimum Design Temperature
The lower bound on the minimum design temperature is the average cosmic background temperature.

#### 05.2.1.3 Design Temperature Modification
The building official is permitted to approve a design with documentation supporting a higher minimmum design temperature or a lower maximum design temperature.

#### 05.2.1.3C Design Temperature Modification
If temperature extremes determined by 05.2.1.1 and 05.2.1.2 are sufficiently short-term (for example, an orbital station eclipsed by its parent body) the structure may not achieve thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.

#### 05.2.1.4 Design Temperature Range
The Design Temperature Range (DTR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Temperature and Maximum Design Temperature.

#### 05.2.1.5 Thermal Design
The structure design shall account for the DTR and thermal gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

### 05.2.2 Pressure
#### 05.2.2.1 Maximum External Design Pressure
*Maximum external design pressure* is the largest of the following options during the service lifetime of the structure:
- the maximum atmospheric pressure,
- maximum fluid pressure in direct contact with the structure

#### 05.2.2.2 Minimum External Design Pressure
*Minimum external design pressure* is the minimum atmospheric pressure during the service lifetime of the structure. If the structure will be exposed to vacuum during its service lifetime then the minimum external design pressure shall be taken as 0 kPa.

#### 05.2.2.4 Design Pressure Range
The Design Pressure Range (DPR) is bounded by the Minimum Design Pressure and Maximum Design Pressure.

#### 05.2.2.5 Pressure Design
The structure design shall account for the DPR and pressure gradients in accordance with Chapter 07.

### 05.2.3 Composition

The structure design shall account for the following aspects of the external atmosphere and material that it may carry:

- chemical reactivity with the structure
- chemical reactivity with the internal atmosphere

If the structure will remain in vacuum for the duration of its service lifetime, then the structure design shall account for:

- chemical reactivity with solar wind

## 05.3 Hazards
This section defines tiers of design considerations.

### 05.3.1 Thermal
#### 05.3.1.1 Thermal Design Category
The DTR as defined in 05.2.1.4 shall be used to define the Thermal Design Category (TDC) as defined in Table 05.3.1.1T.

Table 05.3.1.1T

| Thermal Design Category | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| T1 | DTR entirely between threshold temperatures. |
| T2 | DTR falls partly outside of the threshold temperature ranges. |
| T3 | DTR entirely falls below the lower threshold temperature. |
| T4 | DTR entirely exceeds the higher threshold temperature. |
| T5 | DTR entirely includes the threshold temperature range. |

#### 05.3.1.2 TDC Threshold Temperatures
The lower TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 0 degrees Celsius.
The higher TDC threshold temperature shall be taken as 40 degrees Celsius.

#### 05.3.1.2C TDC Threshold Temperatures
The freezing point of water at STP, 0 degrees Celsius, is used as one of two thresholds to define TDC. 40 degrees Celsius is used as the other thresholds as an upper bound on long-term human survivable temperature.

### 05.3.2 Pressure
#### 05.3.2.1 Pressure Design Category

#### 05.3.1.2 PDC Threshold Pressures
The lower PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []
The higher PDC threshold pressure shall be taken as []

#### 05.3.2.1C Pressure Design Category
The thresholds used to define PDC are based on typically human-survivable pressure ranges. Partial pressure requirements are addressed in []. Emergency underpressure or overpressure requirements are addressed in [].
