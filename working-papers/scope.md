Purpose: this document sets the scope of what is and is not addressed by MBC.

The MBC will serve as a humanity-wide model standard for the design and construction of off-world structures in order to assist all space-facing entities in more affordably and effectively supporting the expansion of humanity beyond Earth, and in order to better serve the needs of the people who will live and work off-world in these structures. MBC will address the life-safety and operability of individual structures.

While the required degree of life-safety and operability may account for the relative importance of a given structure in the context of its surroundings or the community that uses it, MBC will not make any recommendations nor set any requirements concerning the spatial layout of buildings with respect to one another.  Such regulations are typically in the scope of zoning or urban planning authorities. Requirements may flow in the opposite direction (e.g. an adjacent existing structure may impose limitations on the structure being designed), but only in the context of ensuring the desired level of structural performance with respect to occupant health and building operability. A future companion document (e.g. a Multiplanetary Zoning Code) could serve as the counterpart to MBC.
