# Guidelines
Please add enough information with each entry to reasonably accomplish each of the following:
- give credit to the original author(s)
- allow easy access to the referenced item where possible (e.g. a hyperlink)
- a *brief* explanation of why the link is useful to MBC

# papers
*research by others who highlight useful concepts*
- Cohen, Mark M. "Mockups 101: Code and Standard Research for Space Habitat Analogues." DOI: 10.2514/6.2012-5153} Conference: Conference: AIAA SPACE 2012 Conference & Exposition. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268569804_Mockups_101_Code_and_Standard_Research_for_Space_Habitat_Analogues); see Table 5 for list of useful references

# models
*generally, "ways of doing things"*
- NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) [Link](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/lib_docs.cfm?range=7); a good way of issuing bulletins and updates digitally. Links to obsolete documents aren't broken; instead they take the user to a page that makes it clear that the reference is obsolete while still showing the reference. Compare to ASCE 7-10's in-paper method of issuing errata or Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) public bulletins (P/BC).
