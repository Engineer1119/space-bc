# papers
*research by others who highlight useful concepts*
- Cohen, Mark M. "Mockups 101: Code and Standard Research for Space Habitat Analogues." DOI: 10.2514/6.2012-5153} Conference: Conference: AIAA SPACE 2012 Conference & Exposition. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268569804_Mockups_101_Code_and_Standard_Research_for_Space_Habitat_Analogues); see Table 5 for list of useful references

# models
*generally, "ways of doing things"*
- NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) [Link](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/lib_docs.cfm?range=7); a good way of issuing bulletins and updates digitally. Links to obsolete documents aren't broken; instead they take the user to a page that makes it clear that the reference is obsolete while still showing the reference. Compare to ASCE 7-10's in-paper method of issuing errata or Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) public bulletins (P/BC).
- International Code Council (ICC) Bylaws [Link](https://cdn-web.iccsafe.org/wp-content/uploads/bylaws.pdf); Bylaws for the International Code Council, Inc. A California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation, Revised February 2013. Example of bylaws for a code-writing entity. ICC responsible for multiple widely used editions of building codes throughout the U.S.
- American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Bylaws [Link](https://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/About_ASCE/Governance_and_Guiding_Documents/Bylaws%20as%20of%20July%202018.pdf); Bylaws for the largest civil engineering professional organization and advocacy group in the U.S. Bylaws show a thorough example of how to set up a geographically large and multi-tiered hierarchy.
- National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Bylaws [Link](https://www.nfpa.org/-/media/Files/About-NFPA/NFPA-Operations/bylaws.ashx?la=en); see sections 8.2 and 8.3 regarding "document development" as an example of how to codify the process of writing code within the organization.

# code documents
