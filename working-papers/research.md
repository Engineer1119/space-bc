# Guidelines
Please add enough information with each entry to reasonably accomplish each of the following:
- give credit to the original author(s)
- allow easy access to the referenced item where possible (e.g. a hyperlink)
- a *brief* explanation of why the link is useful to MBC

# papers
*research by others who highlight useful concepts*
- Cohen, Mark M. "Mockups 101: Code and Standard Research for Space Habitat Analogues." DOI: 10.2514/6.2012-5153} Conference: Conference: AIAA SPACE 2012 Conference & Exposition. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268569804_Mockups_101_Code_and_Standard_Research_for_Space_Habitat_Analogues); see Table 5 for list of useful references

# models
*generally, "ways of doing things"*
- NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) [Link](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/lib_docs.cfm?range=7); a good way of issuing bulletins and updates digitally. Links to obsolete documents aren't broken; instead they take the user to a page that makes it clear that the reference is obsolete while still showing the reference. Compare to ASCE 7-10's in-paper method of issuing errata or Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) public bulletins (P/BC).

# code documents
*publications that are commonly used as the basis for terrestrial building codes*
- Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures [Link](https://www.asce.org/asce-7/); usually referenced as ASCE 7. Common U.S. reference document for defining loads, load magnitudes, and load combinations.
- Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary [Link](https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=31814&Language=English&Units=US_Units); usually referenced as ACI 318. Common U.S. reference document for design of reinforced concrete structures.
- Steel Construction Manual [Link](https://www.aisc.org/Steel-Construction-Manual-14th-Ed-Fourth-Printing-Print#.XEQcDFxKhPY); usually referenced as AISC or, colloquially, "the steel bible". Common U.S. reference document for design of hot-rolled steel structures.
- Building Code Requirements and Specifications for Masonry Structures [Link](https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=TMSBCR16&Language=English&Units=US_Units); referenced as TMS 402/602, and formerly referenced as ACI 530. Common U.S. reference document for design of masonry structures.
